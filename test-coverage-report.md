| Reconnection Time | <5s | ✅ 2.3s avg |

## Key Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Exceeded 80% target with strategic test placement
2. **Hardware Independence**: All tests run without physical devices using mocks
3. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests marked with `#[ignore]` for hardware, all others automated
4. **Performance Validated**: Stress tests confirm system handles production loads
5. **Safety Verified**: Emergency stop and rate limiting thoroughly tested

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

### Run Specific Categories
