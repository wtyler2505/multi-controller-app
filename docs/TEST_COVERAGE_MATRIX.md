## CI/CD Integration

The coverage matrix integrates with CI/CD:

1. **GitHub Actions** runs tests on every commit
2. **Coverage measurement** via cargo-tarpaulin (Linux) or PowerShell (Windows)
3. **Codecov** tracks coverage trends
4. **PR blocking** if coverage drops below 80%
5. **Matrix updates** on successful merges

## Best Practices

1. **Update matrix after adding tests** - Keep counts accurate
2. **Document test purposes** - Clear test names and comments
3. **Map tests to requirements** - Maintain traceability
4. **Review gaps regularly** - Prioritize based on risk
5. **Automate updates** - Use provided scripts

## Tools and Scripts

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Linux/macOS with tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --out Html --out Lcov

# Windows fallback
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/measure-coverage.ps1
```

### Matrix Management
```powershell
# Update matrix and generate report
./scripts/update-coverage-matrix.ps1 -GenerateReport

# View current gaps
$matrix = Get-Content tests/coverage-matrix.json | ConvertFrom-Json
$matrix.prioritizedGaps | Where-Object { $_.priority -eq "critical" }
```

## Conclusion

The test coverage matrix provides comprehensive tracking of test coverage against requirements. With 80.2% coverage achieved, we've met our initial target. The matrix identifies clear gaps for future work, with safety-critical gaps taking priority.

Regular maintenance of this matrix ensures continued visibility into test coverage health and helps prioritize testing efforts effectively.
