# Risk Analysis and Mitigations

This document enumerates the key risks associated with the Windows Multi‑Controller App project and proposes mitigation strategies. Risks are grouped by category and mapped to tasks in the project backlog where applicable.

| Risk                                                      | Impact                                                                                                                                                            | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Backlog Reference   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Language & UI choice may not meet performance budgets** | If the chosen stack (C# Native AOT or Rust) consumes too much memory or has slow start‑up, the app will fail to meet requirements.                                | Medium     | Build minimal prototypes in both stacks and measure size, start‑up and idle memory【864974145225502†L124-L142】【155744810364120†L12-L16】. Select the stack that meets budgets and document the rationale. | M1‑T4, M1‑T5, M1‑T6 |
| **AOT incompatibility of third‑party libraries**          | Some .NET libraries (e.g., reflection‑heavy JSON serializers) may not work with Native AOT【89652827176451†L120-L128】, causing build failures or runtime issues. | Medium     | Use AOT compatibility analyzers; favour `System.Text.Json` over Newtonsoft; avoid reflection and dynamic code. Verify library compatibility before integration.                                             | M1‑T6, M2‑T1        |
| **Transport instability and timing issues**               | Serial and network connections may experience noise, dropouts or variable latency. Unhandled disconnections could crash the app or leave ports orphaned.          | High       | Implement robust transport layer with asynchronous I/O, exponential backoff and jitter. Create unit and loopback tests to simulate disconnects and soak tests for long‑running stability.                   | M2‑T2, M4‑T4        |
| **Unsafe PWM/analog output can damage hardware**          | Incorrect duty cycles or rapid changes could overheat motors or cause runaway behaviour.                                                                          | High       | Implement global stop, rate limiting and value clamping within drivers. Provide calibration UI and document safe operating ranges.                                                                          | M4‑T3, M3‑T1        |
| **MCP tool misconfiguration or missing dependencies**     | Missing or misconfigured MCP servers could prevent task orchestration, code search or file operations, slowing development.                                       | Medium     | Add `.mcp.json` and `.claude/settings.json` early; test each server; document installation and usage in `docs/mcp/`. Provide fallbacks for local operations if a server is unavailable.                     | M1‑T3, M5‑T3        |

Additional risks such as integration of new devices, script sandbox breaches or configuration errors will be tracked as the project evolves and addressed in future ADRs and backlog tasks.
