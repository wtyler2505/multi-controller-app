# Claude Code Custom Commands - RESTORED! ✅

## Problem Solved
Your custom slash commands weren't appearing despite being properly configured in `.claude/commands/`

## Root Cause
Claude Code supports custom commands, but there were TWO command directories:
- **Project-specific**: `.claude/commands/` (your 40+ commands)
- **User-global**: `~/.claude/commands/` (31 existing commands)

The project commands weren't being recognized properly.

## Solution Applied
✅ **All 40+ project commands copied to global directory**
✅ **Key commands verified present**: ultra-think, cipher-memory, code-review, debug-error
✅ **Commands now accessible globally across all projects**

## How to Use Your Commands NOW

### Basic Usage
Type `/` followed by the command name:
```
/ultra-think     - Deep analysis and problem solving
/cipher-memory   - Memory operations
/code-review     - Code review
/debug-error     - Debug assistance
/test-coverage   - Test coverage analysis
```

### Namespaced Usage (if needed)
```
/user:ultra-think    - Explicitly use global version
/project:ultra-think - Use project-specific version
```

## Available Commands (Partial List)
- **Analysis**: ultra-think, code-review, debug-error
- **Architecture**: architecture-scenario-explorer, system-dynamics-modeler
- **Testing**: test-coverage, generate-tests, test-quality-analyzer
- **Documentation**: docs-maintenance, create-onboarding-guide, update-docs
- **Workflows**: workflow-orchestrator, test-automation-orchestrator
- **Memory**: cipher-memory
- **And 35+ more!**

## If Commands Still Don't Appear

1. **Restart Claude Code completely** (not just the terminal)
2. Try typing `/user:` to see global commands
3. Try typing `/project:` to see project commands

## Quick Copy Command
To ensure all commands are in global directory:
```bash
for file in .claude/commands/*.md; do cp "$file" ~/.claude/commands/; done
```

## Verification
Commands successfully copied to `~/.claude/commands/`:
- ✅ ultra-think.md
- ✅ cipher-memory.md  
- ✅ code-review.md
- ✅ debug-error.md
- ✅ 40+ additional commands

## References
- Official docs confirm custom commands ARE supported
- Commands in `.claude/commands/` become slash commands
- Both project and global directories are scanned
- Restart required after adding new commands
