⚡ Action Items & Next Steps

🎯 Start Now:

- Execute Task 1.1: .NET 8 SDK verification
- Prepare PowerShell scripts for environment validation
- Document findings for stack decision later
- **CRITICAL**: Follow new Verification-First Development protocol from CLAUDE.md
- **MANDATORY**: Use TaskMaster pre-work verification before any implementation

🔄 Process Optimizations:

- Parallel Development: After stack selection, UI and Transport layers can be developed concurrently
- Testing Integration: Begin unit test development alongside feature implementation
- Documentation: Maintain decision log throughout prototyping phase

⚠️ Risk Mitigation:

- Performance Budget Risk: Early prototype benchmarking critical for stack selection
- AOT Compatibility: Verify library compatibility during prototyping phase
