# Cipher Aggregator - Restart Required

## Configuration Restored

âœ… **Original Clear-Thought has been restored in cipher.yml**
- Path: `C:\Users\wtyle\node_modules\@waldzellai\clear-thought\dist\index.js`
- Verified: File exists and is accessible
- Timeout: 45000ms

## To Restart Cipher:

```powershell
# Kill any existing Cipher process
taskkill /F /IM node.exe /FI "WINDOWTITLE eq *cipher*"

# Start Cipher aggregator
cd C:\Users\wtyle\multi-controller-app
npx @byterover/cipher
```

## Expected After Restart:
- Tool count should return to ~105
- Clear-Thought tools will be available
- All 9 MCP servers will be aggregated

Ready to continue with Multi-Controller App development!
