# Cipher System Prompt Fix - Verification Guide

## Problem Solved
✅ **Fixed**: Changed `systemPrompt` to `assistantPrompt` in cipher.yml
✅ **Working**: Cipher now initializes successfully with 106 aggregated tools
✅ **Available**: All MCP servers connected (Desktop Commander, FileScopeMCP, etc.)

## How to Use Cipher Correctly

### ✅ CORRECT: Use ask_cipher for conversations
```bash
/mcp cipher-aggregator ask_cipher "Help me with Multi-Controller App development"
```

### ✅ CORRECT: Use specific aggregated tools
```bash
/mcp cipher-aggregator get_tasks  # Task Master AI
/mcp cipher-aggregator read_file  # Desktop Commander  
/mcp cipher-aggregator list_files # FileScopeMCP
/mcp cipher-aggregator perplexity_ask  # Research
```

### ❌ AVOID: Direct system_prompt calls
```bash
# This will cause role validation errors:
/cipher-aggregator:system_prompt
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check MCP Connection**:
   ```bash
   /mcp
   ```
   Should show `cipher-aggregator` as connected

2. **Test Tool Access**:
   ```bash
   /mcp cipher-aggregator ask_cipher "What tools do I have?"
   ```

3. **Verify Aggregation**:
   ```bash
   /mcp cipher-aggregator get_tasks  # Should work if Task Master connected
   ```

## Configuration Summary

- ✅ `.mcp.json`: Points to correct Cipher path
- ✅ `cipher.yml`: Uses `assistantPrompt` instead of `systemPrompt`
- ✅ MCP servers: All 8 servers configured for aggregation
- ✅ Memory system: Configured with local storage

## Next Steps

1. Use `/mcp cipher-aggregator ask_cipher` for development assistance
2. Access individual tools through Cipher's aggregation
3. Your assistant prompt content is automatically included in all conversations
4. Memory and context are preserved across sessions

The system prompt functionality is working - just not through the direct MCP prompt due to role restrictions. The content is available through normal Cipher interactions.
