# Task 006: Validate Firmware and Protocol Version Compatibility

**Epic**: Connection Handshake Protocol (Task 28)  
**Agent**: handshake-protocol-engineer  
**Status**: Blocked (Depends on 004)  
**Parallel**: Can run parallel with 005 after 004  
**Task Master ID**: 28.6

## Objective
Check device firmware and protocol version for compatibility before session establishment, supporting backward compatibility.

## Dependencies
- Task 004: Capability Negotiation (must be complete)

## Parallel Opportunities
âœ… Can run parallel with Task 005 (both depend only on 004)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Version negotiation logic implemented
- [ ] Compatibility matrix for firmware versions
- [ ] Clear error reporting for incompatible versions
- [ ] Backward compatibility preservation

**Estimated**: 3-4 hours
