# Subtask: Design and Implement SerialTransport Struct

## Description
Create the SerialTransport struct using the latest stable version of the serialport-rs crate, ensuring it adheres to the existing Transport trait and supports cross-platform serial communication. Implement with obsessive focus on RAII cleanup patterns and spawn_blocking for async operations.

## Technical Requirements
- Use serialport-rs for port enumeration, opening, configuration, and I/O
- Ensure compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Implement RAII for resource management
- Use tokio with spawn_blocking for blocking serial operations
- Handle NoDevice errors gracefully with proper error propagation

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create SerialTransport struct definition
- [ ] Implement Transport trait methods
- [ ] Add port enumeration functionality
- [ ] Implement RAII cleanup in Drop trait
- [ ] Add spawn_blocking for async operations
- [ ] Handle NoDevice error cases
- [ ] Add cross-platform compatibility checks

## Test Strategy
- Unit test SerialTransport for port listing, opening, reading, writing, and closing
- Validate cross-platform behavior using MockTransport and real hardware
- Test NoDevice error scenarios and RAII cleanup patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Transport trait fully implemented
- [ ] RAII patterns properly enforced
- [ ] NoDevice errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Cross-platform tests pass
- [ ] Memory safety verified

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundational subtask

## Notes
This subtask is critical for all subsequent device communication functionality. Focus on robustness and proper resource management.
