# Epic: Device Connection and Serial Communication

## Assigned Agent
**serial-comm-specialist** - Domain expert in serialport-rs, async Rust patterns, and cross-platform serial communication

## Objective
Develop robust device connection logic for Arduino and microcontroller devices using serial communication, supporting multiple simultaneous connections and session management.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ SerialTransport struct implementing Transport trait
- ✅ ArduinoDriver implementing DeviceDriver trait  
- ✅ Unique session ID management with cleanup_resources()
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- ✅ Connection lifecycle events with proper error handling
- ✅ RAII patterns and memory safety
- ✅ Async operations with tokio and spawn_blocking

## Key Technical Requirements
- Use serialport-rs crate (latest stable version)
- Implement proper RAII cleanup patterns
- Use spawn_blocking for async serial operations
- Handle NoDevice errors gracefully
- Support multiple simultaneous connections
- Ensure cleanup_resources() called before disconnect

## Subtasks
1. **Design and Implement SerialTransport Struct** - Create cross-platform serial communication
2. **Implement ArduinoDriver and DeviceDriver Trait** - Device-specific logic integration
3. **Session Management and Unique Session IDs** - Multiple connection support
4. **Integrate Connection State with App** - State management integration
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility and Error Handling** - Platform-specific testing

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Unit tests with MockTransport pass
- [ ] Integration tests with real hardware pass
- [ ] Memory leak detection clean
- [ ] Cross-platform validation complete
- [ ] NoDevice error scenarios tested

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Can start immediately (no dependencies)
- Foundational for tasks 28-36
- Critical path component
