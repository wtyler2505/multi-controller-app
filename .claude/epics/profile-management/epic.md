# Epic: Profile Management System

## Assigned Agent
**profile-manager** - TOML serialization and hot-reload expert focused on ProfileManager, versioning, auto-apply, conflict resolution

## Objective
Implement profile save/load, import/export, auto-apply, and versioning for device configurations.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ ProfileManager with CRUD operations
- ✅ TOML format with serde serialization
- ✅ Multiple named profiles support
- ✅ Import/export functionality
- ✅ Hot-reload via notify crate
- ✅ Profile versioning and migration
- ✅ Device matching and auto-apply
- ✅ Conflict resolution and logging

## Key Technical Requirements
- TOML format for profiles
- serde for serialization
- notify crate for hot-reload
- Version migration logic
- Device identifier matching
- Conflict detection algorithms

## Subtasks
1. **Implement Profile CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete
2. **Enable Import/Export and Hot-Reload** - File operations and watching
3. **Implement Versioning and Migration** - Schema evolution support
4. **Develop Device Matching** - Auto-apply mechanism
5. **Handle Conflicts and Logging** - Resolution strategies

## Quality Gates
- [ ] CRUD operations reliable
- [ ] Hot-reload responds <100ms
- [ ] Migration preserves data
- [ ] Auto-apply accurate
- [ ] Conflicts resolved correctly

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Depends on Task 30 (command processing)
- Can run parallel with Tasks 32, 33, 34
- Configuration management feature
