# 001: Monorepo Architecture Setup

## Objective
Initialize and configure monorepo infrastructure for parallel development.

## Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate Nx vs Turborepo for our use case
- [ ] Initialize chosen tool with optimal settings
- [ ] Create workspace structure:
  - `/packages` - Shared libraries
  - `/apps` - Main applications
  - `/tools` - Build and dev tools
  - `/agents` - Agent modules
- [ ] Configure task runners for parallel builds
- [ ] Set up dependency graph visualization

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Can run independently from other subtasks
- Provides foundation but doesn't block initial work

## Agent
