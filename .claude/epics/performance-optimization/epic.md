# Epic: Performance Optimization

## Assigned Agent
**performance-optimizer** - System optimization expert with 5 sub-specializations focused on CPU monitoring, memory optimization, startup time (<2s), idle CPU (<2%), RAM (<150MB)

## Objective
Fix CPU monitoring on Windows, optimize memory and CPU usage, and ensure UI responsiveness during all operations.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Windows CPU monitoring accurate
- ✅ Multi-core reporting correct
- ✅ Rolling average for stable readings
- ✅ Memory usage <150MB idle
- ✅ CPU usage <2% idle
- ✅ Startup time <2 seconds
- ✅ UI maintains 60 FPS
- ✅ CPU trend visualization

## Key Technical Requirements
- sysinfo crate investigation
- Custom Windows CPU logic if needed
- Object pooling and lazy loading
- Async UI updates
- Loading spinners and cancellation
- Performance profiling tools

## Subtasks
1. **Fix Windows CPU Monitoring** - Accurate multi-core reporting
2. **Optimize Memory Usage** - Pooling and lazy loading
3. **Ensure Fast Startup** - <2s startup, <2% idle CPU
4. **Implement Responsive UI** - Async updates and cancellation
5. **Add CPU Trend Visualization** - Real-time usage charts

## Quality Gates
- [ ] CPU monitoring matches Task Manager
- [ ] Memory stays below 150MB
- [ ] Startup completes in <2s
- [ ] UI renders at stable 60 FPS
- [ ] No memory leaks in 8-hour test

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Depends on Tasks 32, 33, 34, 35
- Final optimization pass
- System-wide performance impact
