# Epic: Scripting System

## Assigned Agent
**scripting-architect** - Rhai engine integration expert focused on ScriptManager, sandboxing, device API, concurrent execution

## Objective
Enable script loading, editing, validation, and execution with device API access, sandboxing, and performance monitoring.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Rhai scripting engine integrated
- ✅ ScriptManager for lifecycle management
- ✅ Script import/export support
- ✅ TOML metadata parsing
- ✅ Device control API exposed (sandboxed)
- ✅ Script scheduling and concurrency
- ✅ Debugging and error handling
- ✅ Resource limits and timeouts

## Key Technical Requirements
- Rhai engine (latest stable)
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Device API bindings
- Concurrent script execution
- Resource limit enforcement
- Performance monitoring

## Subtasks
1. **Design ScriptManager** - Script lifecycle management
2. **Expose Device Control API** - Sandboxed API access
3. **Implement Script Scheduling** - Concurrent execution with limits
4. **Add Debugging and Monitoring** - Error handling and performance
5. **Support Import/Export** - TOML metadata management

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Scripts execute in sandbox
- [ ] Device API access restricted
- [ ] Resource limits enforced
- [ ] Concurrent execution stable
- [ ] Debugging tools functional

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Depends on Task 30 (command processing)
- Can run parallel with Tasks 32, 33, 35
- Advanced feature component
