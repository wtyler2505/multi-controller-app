# Epic: Logging System Integration

## Assigned Agent
**logging-integrator** - tracing crate expert focused on structured logging, log capture, filtering, export, rotation

## Objective
Capture and structure all device I/O, user actions, and system events with filtering, export, and log rotation.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ LoggingSystem with device_io buffer integrated
- ✅ LogLevel filtering (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
- ✅ Structured log entries with metadata
- ✅ Log export (JSON, CSV, plain text)
- ✅ Rolling log buffers and rotation
- ✅ tracing crate for structured logging
- ✅ Custom appenders support
- ✅ Remote log transmission capability

## Key Technical Requirements
- tracing crate integration
- Structured logging with metadata
- Rolling buffer implementation
- Log rotation by size/time
- Multi-format export
- Remote transmission security

## Subtasks
1. **Integrate Log Capture** - Device I/O, user actions, system events
2. **Implement LogLevel Filtering** - Severity-based filtering
3. **Support Log Export** - Multi-format export functionality
4. **Implement Log Rotation** - Size and time-based rotation
5. **Enable Structured Logging** - tracing crate and remote transmission

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All event types captured
- [ ] Filtering works correctly
- [ ] Export formats validate
- [ ] Rotation prevents resource exhaustion
- [ ] Remote transmission secure

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Depends on Task 30 (command processing)
- Can run parallel with Tasks 32, 34, 35
- Infrastructure component
