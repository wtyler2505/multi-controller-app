# Epic: Command Processing and Transmission

## Assigned Agent
**command-processor** - Command queue and async transmission expert focused on priority queuing, retry logic, acknowledgments

## Objective
Convert widget inputs to device-specific commands, queue and transmit commands with acknowledgment, retry, and logging.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Command enum for all supported types
- ✅ Command serialization to wire format
- ✅ Async/await non-blocking transmission
- ✅ Command queue with priority handling
- ✅ Batch transmission support
- ✅ Acknowledgment and retry logic
- ✅ Command history in circular buffer
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with timestamps

## Key Technical Requirements
- Strongly-typed Command enum
- Device-specific wire format serialization
- Priority queue implementation
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Thread-safe command queue
- Circular buffer for history

## Subtasks
1. **Define Command Enum and Serialization** - Type-safe command representation
2. **Implement Asynchronous Transmission** - Non-blocking command sending
3. **Build Command Queue** - Priority and batch handling
4. **Add Acknowledgment and Retry Logic** - Reliability mechanisms
5. **Maintain Command History** - Circular buffer and logging

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All command types serializable
- [ ] Async transmission non-blocking
- [ ] Priority ordering verified
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Command history replay functional

## Parallel Execution Notes
- Depends on Task 29 (control widgets)
- Foundation for Tasks 31-36
- Critical for device control
