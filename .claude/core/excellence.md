# Excellence Standards

## Project Philosophy
- **Excellence over Efficiency**: Do it right, not fast
- **Completeness over Brevity**: Full explanations when needed
- **Understanding over Execution**: Know WHY before HOW
- **Robustness over Simplicity**: Handle all edge cases
- **Craftsmanship over Velocity**: This is personal work, not a startup

## User Preferences
- **Communication**: Thorough explanations with complete context
- **GitHub**: wtyler2505 (wtyler2505@outlook.com)
- **Standard**: Personal project excellence, zero commercial pressure

## Development Standards
- **Stack**: Rust with egui - chosen for correctness and control
- **Architecture**: Fully modular, properly abstracted, no shortcuts
- **Testing**: Comprehensive coverage, not "good enough"
- **Documentation**: Every decision recorded with full reasoning
- **Progress Metric**: Quality of implementation, not speed

## Correctness Requirements (NOT Performance Budgets)
- **Functionality**: Works correctly in ALL scenarios
- **Reliability**: Handles every error case gracefully
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, properly structured
- **Extensibility**: Architected for future changes, not just current needs
- **Testing**: Every path validated, every edge case handled

## Tool Mastery (NOT Tool Priority)
1. **TaskMaster** - Complete task understanding before action
2. **Cipher** - Comprehensive memory operations, use all 6 tools properly
3. **FileScope** - Thorough code analysis, understand every dependency
4. **Clear-Thought** - Deep reasoning for every complex decision
5. **All Tools** - Used properly and completely, time is irrelevant

## Verification Discipline
- **Prove everything**: Never assume, always verify with evidence
- **Test thoroughly**: All paths, all cases, all scenarios
- **Document completely**: Full context for every decision
- **Review comprehensively**: Check work multiple times
- **Reference precisely**: `file:line_number` for all code mentions
