# Add Performance Monitoring

Setup application performance monitoring: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Instructions

1. **Performance Monitoring Strategy**
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level objectives (SLOs)
   - Identify critical user journeys and performance bottlenecks
   - Plan monitoring architecture and data collection strategy
   - Assess existing monitoring infrastructure and integration points
   - Define alerting thresholds and escalation procedures

2. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
   - Set up comprehensive APM solution (New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics)
   - Configure distributed tracing for request lifecycle visibility
   - Implement custom metrics and performance tracking
   - Set up transaction monitoring and error tracking
   - Configure performance profiling and diagnostics

3. **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
   - Implement client-side performance tracking and web vitals monitoring
   - Set up user experience metrics collection (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
   - Configure custom performance metrics for user interactions
   - Monitor page load performance and resource loading
   - Track user journey performance across different devices

4. **Server Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Set up process and application-level monitoring
   - Configure event loop lag and garbage collection monitoring
   - Implement custom server performance metrics
   - Monitor resource utilization and capacity planning

5. **Database Performance Monitoring**
   - Track database query performance and slow query identification
   - Monitor database connection pool utilization
   - Set up database performance metrics and alerting
   - Implement query execution plan analysis
   - Monitor database resource usage and optimization opportunities

6. **Error Tracking and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag, Rollbar)
   - Configure error categorization and impact analysis
   - Set up error alerting and notification systems
   - Track error trends and resolution metrics
   - Implement error context and debugging information

7. **Custom Metrics and Dashboards**
   - Implement business metrics tracking (Prometheus, StatsD)
   - Create performance dashboards and visualizations
   - Configure custom alerting rules and thresholds
   - Set up performance trend analysis and reporting
   - Implement performance regression detection

8. **Alerting and Notification System**
   - Configure intelligent alerting based on performance thresholds
   - Set up multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
   - Implement alert escalation and on-call procedures
   - Configure alert fatigue prevention and noise reduction
   - Set up performance incident management workflows

9. **Performance Testing Integration**
   - Integrate monitoring with load testing and performance testing
   - Set up continuous performance testing and monitoring
   - Configure performance baseline tracking and comparison
   - Implement performance test result analysis and reporting
   - Monitor performance under different load scenarios

10. **Performance Optimization Recommendations**
    - Generate actionable performance insights and recommendations
    - Implement automated performance analysis and reporting
    - Set up performance optimization tracking and measurement
    - Configure performance improvement validation
    - Create performance optimization prioritization frameworks

Focus on monitoring strategies that provide actionable insights for performance optimization. Ensure monitoring overhead is minimal and doesn't impact application performance.
