# Stream {X}: {stream_name}

## Scope
{stream_description}

## Files
{file_patterns}

## Progress
- Starting implementation
```

Launch agent using Task tool:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Issue #$ARGUMENTS Stream {X}"
  subagent_type: "{agent_type}"
  prompt: |
    You are working on Issue #$ARGUMENTS in the epic worktree.
    
    Worktree location: ../epic-{epic_name}/
    Your stream: {stream_name}
    
    Your scope:
    - Files to modify: {file_patterns}
    - Work to complete: {stream_description}
    
    Requirements:
    1. Read full task from: .claude/epics/{epic_name}/{task_file}
    2. Work ONLY in your assigned files
    3. Commit frequently with format: "Issue #$ARGUMENTS: {specific change}"
    4. Update progress in: .claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS/stream-{X}.md
    5. Follow coordination rules in /rules/agent-coordination.md
    
    If you need to modify files outside your scope:
    - Check if another stream owns them
    - Wait if necessary
    - Update your progress file with coordination notes
    
    Complete your stream's work and mark as completed when done.
```

### 5. GitHub Assignment

```bash
# Assign to self and mark in-progress
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --add-assignee @me --add-label "in-progress"
```

### 6. Output

```

Epic: {epic_name}
Worktree: ../epic-{epic_name}/

Launching {count} parallel agents:
  Stream A: {name} (Agent-1) âœ“ Started
  Stream B: {name} (Agent-2) âœ“ Started
  Stream C: {name} - Waiting (depends on A)

Progress tracking:
  .claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS/

Monitor with: /pm:epic-status {epic_name}
Sync updates: /pm:issue-sync $ARGUMENTS
```

## Error Handling

If any step fails, report clearly:
- "âŒ {What failed}: {How to fix}"
- Continue with what's possible
- Never leave partial state

## Important Notes

Follow `/rules/datetime.md` for timestamps.
Keep it simple - trust that GitHub and file system work.
