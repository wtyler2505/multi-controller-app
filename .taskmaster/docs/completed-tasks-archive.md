## Task 15 - TypeScript Type Safety (CANCELLED)
**Status**: Task cancelled, but subtasks were completed
**Description**: Remove All 'any' Types and Define Proper Interfaces in SSH Transport (TypeScript)

### Completed Subtasks:

#### 15.1 - Analyze Runtime Structure of 'stream' and 'connectConfig' ✅
- **Description**: Review transports/ssh/src/index.ts at lines 12 and 66 to determine the actual runtime structure and usage of 'stream' and 'connectConfig'. Identify expected properties, methods, and configuration fields based on code and documentation.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Impact**: Successfully identified runtime structures for type definition

#### 15.2 - Define and Document TypeScript Interfaces and Types ✅
- **Description**: Create explicit TypeScript interfaces or type aliases for 'stream' and 'connectConfig' based on the analysis. Use existing types from libraries if available, or define custom interfaces. Add documentation comments for maintainability.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: 15.1
- **Impact**: Created proper TypeScript type definitions

#### 15.3 - Refactor Code to Use New Types and Ensure Strict Mode Compliance ✅
- **Description**: Replace all 'any' types in transports/ssh/src/index.ts with the newly defined interfaces and types. Update function signatures, variable declarations, and return types. Confirm that TypeScript strict mode (including 'noImplicitAny') is fully respected.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: 15.2
- **Impact**: Eliminated all 'any' types, achieved strict mode compliance

#### 15.4 - Write and Review Unit Tests for Type Enforcement ✅
- **Description**: Develop unit tests for functions and methods affected by the new types to ensure correct type enforcement and runtime behavior. Attempt to assign invalid types to verify type safety.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: 15.3
- **Impact**: Comprehensive type safety validation through testing

## Task 19 - TypeScript Path Aliases (CANCELLED)
**Status**: Task cancelled, but subtasks were completed
**Description**: Fix TypeScript Path Aliases Resolution and Ensure Runtime Compatibility

### Completed Subtasks:

#### 19.1 - Review and Update tsconfig.json; Install tsconfig-paths ✅
- **Description**: Examine tsconfig.json to ensure 'baseUrl' and 'paths' are correctly set for all required aliases (e.g., @drivers/*, @transports/*). Install the 'tsconfig-paths' package as a devDependency to enable runtime resolution of these aliases.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Impact**: Proper TypeScript path alias configuration established

#### 19.2 - Update Start, Build, and Test Scripts for Runtime Compatibility ✅
- **Description**: Modify Node.js entrypoints and relevant scripts (e.g., in package.json) to use ts-node with tsconfig-paths/register, ensuring path aliases resolve at runtime. Update build tool and test runner configurations (e.g., webpack, Jest) to match the alias setup.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: 19.1
- **Impact**: Runtime compatibility for TypeScript aliases achieved

#### 19.3 - Verify and Document Alias Usage Across Codebase and Tooling ✅
- **Description**: Search the codebase for imports using the defined aliases and confirm they resolve correctly in the IDE and at runtime. Add documentation to the README explaining the alias setup and usage requirements.
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Dependencies**: 19.2
- **Impact**: Comprehensive alias verification and documentation completed

## Summary

### Completion Statistics:
- **Total Completed Subtasks**: 7
- **Tasks with Completed Work**: 2 (Tasks 15 and 19)
- **Completion Rate**: 100% of subtasks completed within their respective task contexts
- **Quality**: All completed subtasks included proper dependency management and impact documentation

### Technical Achievements:
1. **TypeScript Type Safety**: Complete elimination of 'any' types, strict mode compliance, comprehensive testing
2. **Path Aliases**: Full runtime compatibility, proper tooling configuration, complete documentation
3. **Overall Impact**: Enhanced codebase type safety and developer experience

### Notes:
- Both parent tasks (15 and 19) were ultimately cancelled, but all planned subtasks were completed successfully
- The work done in these subtasks provides valuable foundation for future TypeScript development
- All completed work maintains high quality standards with proper testing and documentation
