Script should create all directories, copy or generate config files, and handle reruns without duplication or errors.

## 4. Integrate Windows Filesystem Compatibility Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Ensure all directory and file names, paths, and script logic comply with Windows filesystem conventions and limitations.
### Details:
Review naming, reserved characters, path lengths, and permissions. Update script and documentation as needed.

## 5. Verify Repository Initialization and Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Execute the automation script and manually inspect the resulting repository to confirm all directories and files are present and correctly configured.
### Details:
Compare the generated structure against the specification. Document any discrepancies and update scripts or templates as needed.
