# Task ID: 4
# Title: Compare Prototypes and Decide Language/Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze performance and developer experience of C# and Rust prototypes to select the optimal stack.
# Details:
Document RAM, CPU, and startup benchmarks. Evaluate UI responsiveness, AOT compatibility, and driver/plugin extensibility. Record trade-offs in docs/decisions/decision-log.md. Prefer .NET 8 Native AOT if performance budgets are met; otherwise, select Rust.

# Test Strategy:
Review benchmark data and developer feedback. Confirm decision is documented and justified in the decision log.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Gather and Document Benchmark Data [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Collect RAM, CPU, and startup time benchmarks for both C# (.NET 8 Native AOT) and Rust prototypes on identical hardware.
### Details:
Run standardized tests for each prototype, record results in a structured format, and ensure reproducibility. Document findings in docs/decisions/decision-log.md.

## 2. Evaluate UI Responsiveness and Developer Experience [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess UI responsiveness and developer workflow for both stacks, including build times, debugging, and tooling.
### Details:
Perform hands-on testing of UI latency and responsiveness. Gather developer feedback on IDE support, error diagnostics, and productivity. Summarize pros/cons in the decision log.

## 3. Assess AOT Compatibility and Extensibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation support and plugin/driver extensibility for both C# and Rust prototypes.
### Details:
Test Native AOT deployment for C# and compare with Rust's compilation model. Evaluate plugin loading mechanisms, manifest parsing, and extensibility features.

## 4. Compare Trade-offs and Document Decision Rationale [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Synthesize benchmark, UI, AOT, and extensibility findings to compare trade-offs between C# and Rust.
### Details:
Summarize strengths, weaknesses, and risks for each stack. Record all trade-offs and rationale in docs/decisions/decision-log.md.

## 5. Select Optimal Language/Framework and Finalize Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Make a final decision on the language/framework based on performance budgets and documented trade-offs.
### Details:
If .NET 8 Native AOT meets performance budgets, select C#; otherwise, select Rust. Update the decision log with justification and notify stakeholders.
