# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Device Abstraction Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement core interfaces (IDeviceDriver, IDeviceSession) for driver plugins and device management.
# Details:
Define interfaces in chosen language (C# or Rust) for device drivers and sessions. Support plugin loading from /drivers/<name> with manifest parsing (TOML/JSON). Ensure hot-plug detection, rate-limiting, and safety hooks (global stop). Use reflection (C#) or dynamic loading (Rust) for extensibility.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for interface compliance, plugin loading, and manifest parsing. Simulate hot-plug events and verify safety actions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Core Device Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the IDeviceDriver and IDeviceSession interfaces in the chosen language (C# or Rust), specifying required methods and properties for device abstraction and management.
### Details:
Establish clear, concise interfaces that encapsulate device driver and session responsibilities, ensuring extensibility and maintainability. Follow best practices for abstraction layer API design, focusing on simplicity and documentation.

## 2. Implement Plugin Loading and Manifest Parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the mechanism to load driver plugins from the /drivers/<name> directory, including parsing plugin manifests in TOML or JSON format.
### Details:
Utilize reflection (C#) or dynamic loading (Rust) to discover and instantiate plugins at runtime. Implement robust manifest parsing to extract metadata and configuration for each plugin.

## 3. Integrate Hot-Plug Detection and Rate-Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add support for detecting device hot-plug events and implement rate-limiting to prevent resource exhaustion or rapid cycling.
### Details:
Monitor device connection/disconnection events and trigger appropriate driver/session lifecycle actions. Implement configurable rate-limiting to manage event frequency and system stability.

## 4. Implement Safety Hooks and Global Stop Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Design and implement safety hooks, including a global stop function to ensure safe shutdown or interruption of all device operations.
### Details:
Provide a centralized mechanism to halt all device activity in response to critical errors or user commands, ensuring system safety and integrity.

## 5. Validate Extensibility and Interface Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Ensure the abstraction layer supports extensibility via reflection or dynamic loading, and that all plugins conform to the defined interfaces.
### Details:
Perform integration tests with multiple sample plugins, verifying correct loading, interface adherence, and runtime extensibility in both C# and Rust environments.
