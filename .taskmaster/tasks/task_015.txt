# Task ID: 15
# Title: Remove All 'any' Types and Define Proper Interfaces in SSH Transport (TypeScript)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace all 'any' types in transports/ssh/src/index.ts (lines 12 and 66) with explicit, well-defined TypeScript interfaces and types, ensuring strict mode compliance.
# Details:
Review transports/ssh/src/index.ts, focusing on line 12 (stream) and line 66 (connectConfig), where 'any' types are currently used. For each, analyze the actual runtime structure and usage:

- For 'stream', determine its expected properties and methods (e.g., is it a Node.js Stream, SSH2 stream, or custom object?). Define a TypeScript interface or use an existing type from relevant libraries (such as Node.js 'stream.Stream' or SSH2 types) to accurately represent its shape.
- For 'connectConfig', identify all required and optional configuration fields (host, port, username, authentication, etc.). Create a dedicated interface (e.g., 'SshConnectConfig') that explicitly lists all fields with correct types and documentation.
- Refactor all code that currently uses 'any' to use these new types, updating function signatures, variable declarations, and return types as needed.
- Ensure all type definitions are exported and documented for maintainability.
- Confirm that TypeScript strict mode (including 'noImplicitAny') is fully respected and no 'any' types remain, either explicit or implicit.
- If third-party types are unavailable, define custom interfaces based on observed usage and documentation.
- Run a full type check to verify compliance and resolve any new type errors introduced by stricter typing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run 'tsc --strict' and confirm that no 'any' types (explicit or implicit) remain in transports/ssh/src/index.ts.
2. Write unit tests for functions and methods affected by the new types, ensuring correct type enforcement and runtime behavior.
3. Attempt to assign invalid types to 'stream' and 'connectConfig' in test code and verify that TypeScript raises compile-time errors.
4. Review code coverage to ensure all branches using the new types are exercised.
5. Peer review the new interfaces for completeness and clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Runtime Structure of 'stream' and 'connectConfig' [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review transports/ssh/src/index.ts at lines 12 and 66 to determine the actual runtime structure and usage of 'stream' and 'connectConfig'. Identify expected properties, methods, and configuration fields based on code and documentation.
### Details:
Investigate whether 'stream' is a Node.js Stream, SSH2 stream, or custom object, and enumerate its properties and methods. For 'connectConfig', list all required and optional fields (host, port, username, authentication, etc.) and their types.

## 2. Define and Document TypeScript Interfaces and Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create explicit TypeScript interfaces or type aliases for 'stream' and 'connectConfig' based on the analysis. Use existing types from libraries if available, or define custom interfaces. Add documentation comments for maintainability.
### Details:
Define a dedicated interface (e.g., 'SshConnectConfig') for configuration, and select or create an appropriate type for 'stream'. Ensure all type definitions are exported and include JSDoc comments describing each field.

## 3. Refactor Code to Use New Types and Ensure Strict Mode Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Replace all 'any' types in transports/ssh/src/index.ts with the newly defined interfaces and types. Update function signatures, variable declarations, and return types. Confirm that TypeScript strict mode (including 'noImplicitAny') is fully respected.
### Details:
Refactor affected code sections to use explicit types. Run 'tsc --strict' to verify that no explicit or implicit 'any' types remain. Address any type errors introduced by stricter typing.

## 4. Write and Review Unit Tests for Type Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Develop unit tests for functions and methods affected by the new types to ensure correct type enforcement and runtime behavior. Attempt to assign invalid types to verify type safety.
### Details:
Write tests that validate correct usage of 'stream' and 'connectConfig' types, and confirm that TypeScript catches invalid assignments. Review test coverage and update as needed.
