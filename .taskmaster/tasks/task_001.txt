# Task ID: 1
# Title: Verify Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all required SDKs and toolchains (.NET 8 SDK, Rust toolchain, Node 18+) are installed and configured for Windows 11 development.
# Details:
Check for .NET 8 SDK (Native AOT support), Rust stable toolchain, and Node.js 18+ using PowerShell scripts. Validate installation paths and environment variables. Document any missing prerequisites.

# Test Strategy:
Run version checks for each toolchain; attempt to build and run a 'Hello World' for each environment to confirm setup.

# Subtasks:

## 2. Verify Rust Stable Toolchain Installation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the Rust stable toolchain is installed and properly configured for Windows 11 development.
### Details:
Check for Rust installation using 'rustup' and confirm the stable MSVC toolchain is present. Validate that '%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin' is in the PATH environment variable. Confirm installation by running 'cargo --version' and 'rustc --version'.

## 3. Validate Node.js 18+ Installation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Confirm that Node.js version 18 or higher is installed and available for use.
### Details:
Use PowerShell to check Node.js version and validate installation path. Ensure Node.js is accessible from the command line and included in the PATH environment variable.

## 4. Check and Document Environment Variables and Installation Paths [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Validate that all required environment variables and installation paths for .NET, Rust, and Node.js are correctly set.
### Details:
Use PowerShell scripts to inspect PATH and other relevant environment variables. Document any misconfigurations or missing entries for each toolchain.

## 5. Report and Document Missing Prerequisites [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document any missing SDKs, toolchains, or configuration issues required for Windows 11 development.
### Details:
Aggregate results from previous checks. Create a report listing missing prerequisites, misconfigurations, and recommended remediation steps.
