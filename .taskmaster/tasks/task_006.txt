# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Transport Layer (Serial, TCP/UDP, SSH)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement transport modules for serial, TCP/UDP (with mDNS/manual), and SSH (for Raspberry Pi), including reconnect/backoff logic.
# Details:
Use System.IO.Ports (C#) or serialport-rs (Rust) for serial; System.Net.Sockets (C#) or tokio (Rust) for TCP/UDP; SSH.NET (C#) or thrussh (Rust) for SSH. Implement exponential backoff for reconnects. Integrate transport selection via manifest. Ensure all transports meet latency budgets.

# Test Strategy:
Automated tests for device discovery, connection, and reconnection. Measure writeâ†’ack and network latency. Fuzz serial framing for robustness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Serial Transport Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the serial communication transport using System.IO.Ports (C#) or serialport-rs (Rust), supporting configuration (baud rate, parity, stop bits, flow control) and robust data handling.
### Details:
Ensure correct initialization, connection management, and error handling for serial ports. Support asynchronous read/write and buffer management. Integrate event-driven or async patterns for data reception.

## 2. Implement TCP/UDP Transport Module with mDNS and Manual Discovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop TCP/UDP transport using System.Net.Sockets (C#) or tokio (Rust), supporting both mDNS-based and manual device discovery.
### Details:
Implement connection setup, data transmission, and reception for both TCP and UDP. Integrate mDNS for automatic device discovery and fallback to manual IP/port entry. Ensure compatibility with network latency requirements.

## 3. Implement SSH Transport Module for Raspberry Pi [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop SSH transport using SSH.NET (C#) or thrussh (Rust) to enable secure communication with Raspberry Pi devices.
### Details:
Support authentication, session management, and secure data tunneling. Handle connection setup, command execution, and data streaming over SSH.

## 4. Integrate Exponential Backoff and Reconnect Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement exponential backoff and reconnection strategies for all transport modules to ensure robust recovery from connection failures.
### Details:
Design a unified reconnection framework with configurable backoff parameters. Ensure all transports can recover gracefully from transient errors and meet latency budgets.

## 5. Implement Transport Selection and Manifest Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Develop logic to select and configure the appropriate transport based on a manifest, ensuring seamless integration and adherence to latency requirements.
### Details:
Parse manifest files to determine transport configuration. Dynamically instantiate and manage transport modules as specified. Validate that selected transports meet performance and latency constraints.
