# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Telemetry, Profiles, and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time telemetry charts, profile save/load, and rolling logs for device I/O and events.
# Details:
Use fixed-size ring buffers (min 2k samples) for telemetry; render charts at ~30 FPS using WinUI 3 or Rust charting libs. Implement profile management with JSON/TOML hot-reload. Add rolling log buffers and one-click export. Ensure RAM usage stays within budget.

# Test Strategy:
Automated tests for telemetry rendering, profile load/save, and log export. Soak tests for RAM drift and performance over 8-hour runs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Fixed-Size Telemetry Ring Buffers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement fixed-size ring buffers (minimum 2,000 samples) for capturing real-time telemetry data from device I/O and events.
### Details:
Ensure efficient memory usage and thread-safe access for concurrent data producers and consumers. The buffer should support fast overwrite of oldest data and expose APIs for chart rendering and export.

## 2. Render Real-Time Telemetry Charts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Integrate a charting library (WinUI 3 compatible, e.g., LiveCharts2, Telerik, or Syncfusion) to render telemetry data at approximately 30 FPS.
### Details:
Bind chart data sources to the ring buffer. Implement efficient UI updates and ensure smooth rendering with minimal CPU/GPU overhead. Support multiple chart types as needed for device telemetry.

## 3. Develop Profile Management with Hot-Reload [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement profile save/load functionality using JSON or TOML, supporting hot-reload of configuration changes at runtime.
### Details:
Profiles should capture user and device settings. Monitor profile files for changes and apply updates without restarting the application. Ensure robust error handling for malformed profiles.

## 4. Implement Rolling Log Buffers and Export [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create rolling log buffers for device I/O and event logs, with support for one-click export to file.
### Details:
Use a fixed-size buffer to limit RAM usage. Provide APIs for appending, querying, and exporting logs. Ensure exported logs are complete and formatted for analysis.

## 5. Enforce RAM Usage Budget and Monitor Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Integrate monitoring and safeguards to ensure total RAM usage for telemetry, profiles, and logs remains within defined limits.
### Details:
Implement runtime checks and alerts for memory usage. Optimize data structures and buffer sizes as needed. Document RAM budget assumptions and provide configuration options.
