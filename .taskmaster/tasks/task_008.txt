# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Scripting Runtime and API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Embed a sandboxed scripting engine (JavaScript, Lua, or Python) with APIs for device control and telemetry.
# Details:
Select scripting engine based on performance and AOT compatibility (e.g., ClearScript for JS, MoonSharp for Lua, Python.NET for Python). Expose APIs: devices.list(), dev.call(endpoint, args). Restrict file/network access for sandboxing. Document API usage and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration tests for script execution, API calls, and sandbox enforcement. Run sample scripts to validate device control and telemetry access.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Evaluate and Select Scripting Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess candidate scripting engines (JavaScript, Lua, Python) for performance, AOT compatibility, and sandboxing capabilities. Choose the most suitable engine for embedding.
### Details:
Compare engines such as ClearScript (JS), MoonSharp (Lua), and Python.NET (Python) with respect to execution speed, memory usage, ease of embedding, and ability to restrict file/network access. Document the selection rationale.

## 2. Embed and Configure Sandboxed Scripting Runtime [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Integrate the selected scripting engine into the host application and configure it to enforce sandboxing, restricting file and network access.
### Details:
Embed the engine, set up execution contexts, and apply sandboxing policies to prevent unauthorized file system and network operations. Ensure the runtime is isolated from the host environment.

## 3. Expose Device Control and Telemetry APIs to Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement and register APIs (devices.list(), dev.call(endpoint, args)) within the scripting environment for device control and telemetry access.
### Details:
Design API bindings that allow scripts to enumerate devices and invoke device endpoints securely. Ensure APIs are accessible only within the sandboxed context.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and API Usage Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Define error handling strategies for API calls and document API usage, expected inputs/outputs, and error cases for script developers.
### Details:
Standardize error responses for API failures. Create comprehensive documentation covering API signatures, usage examples, and error scenarios.

## 5. Develop and Execute Integration and Security Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Create unit and integration tests for script execution, API calls, and sandbox enforcement. Validate the system with sample scripts and security scenarios.
### Details:
Design test cases covering normal and edge-case script usage, API interactions, and attempts to bypass sandbox restrictions. Include both automated and manual test scripts.
