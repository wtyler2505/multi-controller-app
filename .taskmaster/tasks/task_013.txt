# Task ID: 13
# Title: Enforce Serial Latency Budget and Instrument send() Timing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Instrument the serial transport's send() method to measure and enforce a â‰¤50ms latency budget, emitting warnings and enforcing timeouts when exceeded.
# Details:
Modify transports/serial/src/index.ts, specifically lines 59-69 within the send() method, to capture precise timing metrics for each send operation. Use a high-resolution timer (e.g., process.hrtime.bigint() in Node.js or equivalent) to record the start and end time of each send. Calculate the elapsed time for each operation and compare it to the 50ms performance budget. If the latency exceeds 50ms, emit a structured warning event (e.g., 'serial-latency-warning') with details including the measured latency, timestamp, and relevant context. If the operation cannot complete within 50ms, enforce a hard timeout by aborting the send and emitting an error event. Integrate this logic such that it does not introduce significant overhead or interfere with normal operation. Ensure that all timing and warning logic is covered by unit tests and that emitted events are documented for downstream consumers. Consider edge cases such as partial writes, retries, and system clock anomalies. All changes must maintain compatibility with the transport layer's reconnect/backoff and error handling logic.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests that simulate send() operations with controlled timing to verify that latency is measured accurately and warnings are emitted when the 50ms threshold is exceeded. 2. Use integration tests to simulate high-latency scenarios (e.g., by injecting artificial delays) and confirm that timeouts are enforced and error events are emitted as specified. 3. Verify that normal send operations under the latency budget do not emit warnings or errors. 4. Ensure that all emitted events contain the correct metadata and are received by downstream listeners. 5. Run soak tests to confirm that the instrumentation does not introduce memory leaks or significant performance overhead.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Instrument send() with High-Resolution Timing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the send() method in transports/serial/src/index.ts to capture precise start and end timestamps for each send operation using a high-resolution timer (e.g., process.hrtime.bigint() or performance.now()). Calculate the elapsed time for each send.
### Details:
Ensure the timing logic is accurate to sub-millisecond precision and does not interfere with normal operation. Consider using process.hrtime for maximum precision in Node.js environments.

## 2. Implement Warning and Error Event Emission [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Emit a structured 'serial-latency-warning' event if the measured latency exceeds 50ms, including details such as measured latency, timestamp, and context. Emit an error event if a hard timeout is enforced.
### Details:
Ensure events are emitted in a way that is compatible with the existing event system and provide all required contextual information for downstream consumers.

## 3. Enforce Timeout Logic in send() [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Implement logic to abort the send operation if it cannot complete within the 50ms latency budget, ensuring a hard timeout is enforced and the appropriate error event is emitted.
### Details:
Handle edge cases such as partial writes, retries, and ensure compatibility with reconnect/backoff and error handling logic in the transport layer.

## 4. Write Unit and Integration Tests for Latency and Event Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify accurate latency measurement, correct event emission, and proper enforcement of the 50ms timeout under various scenarios.
### Details:
Simulate controlled timing, high-latency scenarios, partial writes, and retries. Ensure all new logic is fully covered by tests.

## 5. Document Event Structure and Update Downstream Consumer Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Document the structure of emitted warning and error events, and update documentation for downstream consumers to reflect the new event types and their usage.
### Details:
Provide clear examples and descriptions of event payloads, and ensure documentation is accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
