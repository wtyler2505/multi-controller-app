# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Secure Credential Management for SSH Transport
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace plain text password storage in SSH transport with encrypted, securely managed credentials, ensuring protection against memory dumps and compliance with security best practices.
# Details:
Refactor transports/ssh/src/index.ts to eliminate all instances where SSH credentials (passwords, private keys, etc.) are stored in plain text memory (lines 16-17, 72-76). Implement a secure credential management system that uses strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) for any in-memory or on-disk storage of secrets. Integrate with a secure OS-provided credential vault (such as Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service) where possible. Ensure that decrypted credentials are only present in memory for the minimum time required and are immediately zeroed out after use. Use secure memory allocation techniques (e.g., node-keytar, node-ffi-napi with mlock, or Rust's secrecy crate) to prevent credentials from being swapped to disk or exposed in memory dumps. Document the cryptographic approach and key management strategy. Ensure that the solution is compatible with both password and key-based SSH authentication, and does not degrade user experience or automation workflows. Conduct a code review and threat modeling session to identify and mitigate any remaining risks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit and integration tests to verify that credentials are never stored or logged in plain text at any point in the SSH transport lifecycle. 2. Use memory inspection tools (such as heap snapshots and process memory dumps) to confirm that decrypted credentials do not persist in memory after use. 3. Attempt to access credentials via simulated memory dump attacks and verify that secrets are not recoverable. 4. Test compatibility with both password and key-based authentication, ensuring no regression in SSH connection functionality. 5. Review code for compliance with NIST IR 7966 and industry best practices for SSH credential management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify All Credential Storage Locations in SSH Transport [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit the SSH transport codebase (transports/ssh/src/index.ts) to locate all instances where credentials (passwords, private keys, etc.) are stored, referenced, or handled in memory or on disk, including lines 16-17 and 72-76.
### Details:
Document each location and method of credential storage or handling, including temporary variables, logs, and any serialization/deserialization points.

## 2. Design Encryption and Secure Memory Handling Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop a cryptographic approach for encrypting credentials using strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256) and define secure memory handling practices to minimize exposure and prevent memory dumps.
### Details:
Specify encryption libraries, key management strategy, secure memory allocation techniques (e.g., mlock, zeroization), and procedures for minimizing credential lifetime in memory.

## 3. Integrate with OS Credential Vaults [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Implement integration with OS-provided credential vaults (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) for secure storage and retrieval of SSH credentials.
### Details:
Abstract vault interactions to support cross-platform compatibility and ensure fallback mechanisms if a vault is unavailable.

## 4. Refactor SSH Transport to Use Secure Credential Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Replace all plain text credential handling in SSH transport with the new encrypted and vault-backed credential management system.
### Details:
Update transports/ssh/src/index.ts and related modules to use secure APIs for credential access, ensuring decrypted secrets are only present in memory when strictly necessary and are zeroed out after use.

## 5. Write Unit and Integration Tests for Credential Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests to verify that credentials are never stored or logged in plain text and that decrypted secrets do not persist in memory after use.
### Details:
Use memory inspection tools and automated tests to validate secure handling for both password and key-based authentication workflows.

## 6. Document Cryptographic Approach and Key Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Produce detailed documentation covering the cryptographic methods, key management strategy, secure memory handling, and integration with OS credential vaults.
### Details:
Include rationale for chosen algorithms, threat modeling outcomes, and operational guidance for developers and auditors.
