# Task ID: 19
# Title: Fix TypeScript Path Aliases Resolution and Ensure Runtime Compatibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Ensure that TypeScript path aliases defined in tsconfig.json (e.g., @drivers/*, @transports/*) are correctly resolved at both build time and runtime by installing and configuring the tsconfig-paths package, preventing module resolution errors.
# Details:
1. **Review tsconfig.json**: Confirm that the 'baseUrl' and 'paths' fields are correctly set for all required aliases (e.g., @drivers/*, @transports/*) in the compilerOptions section. Example:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "@drivers/*": ["drivers/*"],
    "@transports/*": ["transports/*"]
  }
}
```

2. **Install tsconfig-paths**: Add the 'tsconfig-paths' package as a devDependency to the project. This package is required for runtime resolution of path aliases in Node.js environments, as TypeScript itself only rewrites paths at compile time, not at runtime[1][4].

3. **Update Node.js entrypoints**: For any Node.js scripts (e.g., main.ts, index.ts, or test runners) that use path aliases, update the start scripts in package.json or relevant launch scripts to use ts-node with tsconfig-paths, e.g.:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register src/index.ts"
}
```

4. **Build pipeline**: If using a build tool (e.g., webpack, esbuild), ensure its configuration also resolves the same aliases, or that the build output does not contain unresolved aliases.

5. **Documentation**: Add a note to the project README explaining the need for tsconfig-paths and how to use the correct start/build commands.

6. **Verify all imports**: Search the codebase for any imports using @drivers/* or @transports/* and ensure they resolve correctly both in the IDE and at runtime.

7. **Optional**: If using Jest or other test runners, ensure their configuration (e.g., moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js) is updated to match the aliases.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run 'tsc' to confirm there are no TypeScript errors related to unresolved modules using aliases.
2. Start the application using the updated start script (with tsconfig-paths/register) and verify that all modules imported via aliases load correctly at runtime, with no 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' errors.
3. Add or update a unit test that imports a module using an alias and confirm it runs successfully.
4. If using a test runner (e.g., Jest), run the test suite and ensure all tests pass without module resolution errors.
5. Remove tsconfig-paths/register from the start script and confirm that runtime errors occur, demonstrating the necessity of the fix (then restore it).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Review and Update tsconfig.json; Install tsconfig-paths [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine tsconfig.json to ensure 'baseUrl' and 'paths' are correctly set for all required aliases (e.g., @drivers/*, @transports/*). Install the 'tsconfig-paths' package as a devDependency to enable runtime resolution of these aliases.
### Details:
Check that all necessary path aliases are defined in tsconfig.json under compilerOptions. Run 'npm install --save-dev tsconfig-paths'.

## 2. Update Start, Build, and Test Scripts for Runtime Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Modify Node.js entrypoints and relevant scripts (e.g., in package.json) to use ts-node with tsconfig-paths/register, ensuring path aliases resolve at runtime. Update build tool and test runner configurations (e.g., webpack, Jest) to match the alias setup.
### Details:
Update 'start' and other scripts to include '-r tsconfig-paths/register'. Adjust build tool and test runner configs to resolve the same aliases.

## 3. Verify and Document Alias Usage Across Codebase and Tooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Search the codebase for imports using the defined aliases and confirm they resolve correctly in the IDE and at runtime. Add documentation to the README explaining the alias setup and usage requirements.
### Details:
Test imports in development and production builds. Update README with instructions for using tsconfig-paths and correct start/build commands.
