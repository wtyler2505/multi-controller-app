# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Arduino Device Driver (IDeviceDriver) with ProbeAsync, OpenAsync, and manifest.json
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a fully functional Arduino device driver by implementing the IDeviceDriver interface, including ProbeAsync, OpenAsync, and manifest.json, enabling hardware communication with Arduino devices.
# Details:
Begin by reviewing the IDeviceDriver interface and its requirements as defined in the device abstraction layer. Implement the Arduino driver in drivers/arduino/src/index.ts (or the appropriate language/module), ensuring the following:

- **ProbeAsync**: Scan available serial ports to detect connected Arduino devices. Use platform-specific APIs or libraries (e.g., System.IO.Ports in C#, serialport-rs in Rust) to enumerate ports and identify Arduino boards by USB VID/PID or serial signature. Return device metadata if found.

- **OpenAsync**: Establish a connection to the Arduino device using the selected serial port. Configure baud rate and other serial parameters as required by the Arduino firmware. Implement robust error handling for connection failures and ensure proper resource cleanup on disconnect.

- **manifest.json**: Create a manifest.json (or manifest.toml) describing the driver, supported hardware, transport requirements (serial), and any configuration parameters. Ensure the manifest is correctly parsed and loaded by the plugin system.

- **Hardware Protocol**: If a specific protocol (e.g., Firmata, custom command set) is required for communication, implement the necessary message framing and parsing logic. Use existing crates/libraries (e.g., arduino-hal, embedded-hal for Rust) where possible to facilitate communication and hardware abstraction[3][4][5].

- **Documentation**: Document the driver’s usage, configuration, and any hardware prerequisites. Provide example code for basic operations (e.g., toggling a pin, reading a sensor).

- **Extensibility**: Structure the code to allow for future extension to other microcontroller families by adhering strictly to the IDeviceDriver interface and abstraction patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for ProbeAsync and OpenAsync to simulate device discovery and connection scenarios, including error cases (e.g., device not found, port busy).
2. Connect a physical Arduino device and verify that ProbeAsync correctly detects it and OpenAsync establishes a working session.
3. Validate that manifest.json is parsed and loaded by the plugin system, and that driver metadata is correctly reported.
4. Perform end-to-end tests by sending commands to the Arduino (e.g., toggle an LED, read a pin) and verifying correct hardware response.
5. Test resource cleanup and error handling by repeatedly connecting/disconnecting the device and simulating communication failures.
