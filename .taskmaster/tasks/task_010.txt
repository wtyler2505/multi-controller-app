# Task ID: 10
# Title: Automated Testing and Final Acceptance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and run unit, loopback, soak, and acceptance tests to verify all functional and non-functional requirements.
# Details:
Use xUnit/NUnit (C#) or cargo test (Rust) for unit tests. Simulate device connections and control flows. Run soak tests for 8+ hours to monitor RAM drift and stability. Validate safety actions and performance budgets. Document results and acceptance criteria.

# Test Strategy:
Run full test suite; review logs and performance metrics. Confirm all success metrics and safety requirements are met before release.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop and Execute Unit Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and run unit tests for all core modules using xUnit/NUnit (C#) or cargo test (Rust) to verify functional correctness at the code level.
### Details:
Set up test projects, implement test cases for individual functions and classes, and ensure all critical logic paths are covered. Use assertions to validate expected outcomes.

## 2. Implement and Run Loopback Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Simulate device connections and control flows to verify communication integrity and protocol handling between software components.
### Details:
Configure test harnesses to emulate device endpoints and control flows. Validate correct data transmission, reception, and error handling under loopback conditions.

## 3. Conduct Soak Tests for Stability [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Run extended soak tests (8+ hours) to monitor RAM drift, resource leaks, and overall system stability under sustained load.
### Details:
Automate long-duration test runs with simulated device activity and control flows. Track memory usage, CPU load, and system responsiveness throughout the test period.

## 4. Validate Safety Actions and Performance Budgets [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Verify that all safety-critical actions and performance requirements are met under test conditions, including emergency controls and latency budgets.
### Details:
Test safety mechanisms (e.g., emergency stop, fail-safe triggers) and measure system performance against defined budgets. Simulate edge cases and failure scenarios.

## 5. Document Test Results and Acceptance Criteria [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Compile and organize all test results, logs, and metrics. Clearly document acceptance criteria and final verification status for project release.
### Details:
Aggregate test outputs, summarize findings, and record pass/fail status for each requirement. Prepare documentation for stakeholder review and final acceptance.
